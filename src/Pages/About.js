            I am a mobile app developer with two years of focused study and hands-on experience in Kotlin, Swift, and Figma. I specialize in applying MVVM architecture, REST APIs, and Firebase/Firestore in my projects. My background also includes strong skills in full stack web development, particularly in JavaScript, React, NodeJS, and MongoDB. <br /> 
            <br />

Previously, I worked as a programming instructor at ReDi Bootcamp in Berlin, where I shared my passion for software development. Outside of work, I enjoy cooking, traveling, and cycling. My global experiences in 38 countries have sharpened my teamwork, management, and organizational skills. With over 10 years in kitchens, I excel in team environments and am committed to continuous improvement. </p>
