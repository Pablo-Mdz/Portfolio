            I am a software developer specializing in mobile app development, with expertise in Figma, Kotlin, and Swift. I honed my mobile development skills at the Syntax Institut, where I learned to apply MVVM architecture, REST API, Firebase/Firestore, Moshi, Retrofit, Coroutines, and CoreData in my applications. <br></br>

I have also completed a full stack web development bootcamp at Ironhack Berlin in 2022, where I gained strong skills in JavaScript, React, NodeJS, and MongoDB. Since then, I have been continuously learning and programming. <br />

Additionally, I work as a programming instructor at the ReDi bootcamp in Berlin, where I share my knowledge and passion for software development with students. Outside of my professional life, my interests include cooking, traveling, and cycling. <br />

I have had the privilege of traveling to 38 countries and working in 5 of them, using my skills in teamwork, organizational tasks, task optimization, management, advice, and service in various environments, including private and public events. With over 10 years of experience working in kitchens, I am a sociable person who excels in team environments and is committed to constant improvement.   </p>
